### Thought Process

* First decided the layout of Card View in which the information of user can be displayed
* Brainstormed about various ways to demonstrate and implement Navigation Routing
* Came up with an idea of Login and Signup
* Dropped the idea as implementation of this would take more time and I didn't wanted to implement asyncStorage based authentication process as memory gets clear after every uninstall
* Came up with an idea to implement BottomNavigation and display about of this project (which basically will be Readme page of this project explaining everything about this project)
* Brainstormed about some another way to demonstrate and implement Navigation Activity.
* Came up with an idea to implement Google based search according to the Card clicked. This way it will be possible to demonstrate data transfer from opne page to another like user.name and also provide some useful information like Linkedin, Youtube and other links provided by Google.

### Challenges Faced

* Image setup problem as to setup the top of the user out of the square box to demonstrate a catchy UI.
* Navigation problem on reload after renaming the screens.
* WebView Component unavailability in Web Mode.
* Setup of project in requested folder structure which was new for me instead of the deult typescript one where index.tsx used to serve as entry point.

### Design & Tech Decisions

* Design implemented in Stylesheet manner with inline styling at minor some places
* Axios used for API handling
* Javascript used throughout the app development process

### Unfinished ideas I could have implemented in more time

* implementation of cloud based Login and Signup functionality.
* More better UI/UX design
* Implementation of Web Scraping to directly provide related Linkedin, Youtube links of that specific person clicked instead of currently implemented Google Page display
* Would have tried to cover more edge case scenarios
* Would have implemented more Screens like Splash Screen and About Page which displays the information of the current user logged in and a Logout button.
* Would have also designed and attached a logo for the app.
