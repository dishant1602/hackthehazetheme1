# App Overview

This app displays a list of user data available through the API response.

The user details are displayed in FlatList View and upon selection of specific user, a Google Chrome webpage is opened with their name as a query and available links are provided to user.

To demonstrate the functionality of Navigation, above step was taken and despite that BottomNavBar approach is also used to show two tabs with one Tab as Main User FlatList Page and the other page showing the readme file of this proect from the Github via WebView component.
